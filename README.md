# Login-Page-using-Tkinter

•	This interactive login page was created using Tkinter
•	Initially before starting we need to import tkinter library
•	Store the credentials and use the get() method of each Entry widget to retrieve the data that the user entered.

•	We have used the basic commands the tkinter has such has button: to create buttons
•	Color options to add colors, using text for entry of the texts etc.

•	Using the background option to add background image to the page
•	Functions such as
1.	For Retrieving text with .get()
2.	For Deleting text with .delete()
3.	For Inserting text with .insert()

For further improvisation of the mini project:
We can connect the create to a database to store the data, check the correctness of the data entered, and for further use of the entered data.
